# Formal Methods
There are methods that use theories, methods and mathematical rules to transform the system from ordinary natural language into mathematical formulas that can be studied, compared, and corrected for errors in any system we want to build. Using normal natural language, we may find there are deficiencies in the requirements for each system we want to develop and create, and when we try to use and enter the requirements we may find that there is a contradiction and conflict, and this will cause the system to fail. The later stages will be delayed and may affect the health of the system, and the error from the beginning is less than repairing it after continuing to build the system at a later time; Therefore, we need something to make sure that the system is correct and does not contain errors, and the graphic description we do after completing the requirements analysis. This graphic description uses mathematical models because mathematics can more easily treat many errors in the system and discover problems, and if we do the formal description, which is the mathematical representation, we return the system to natural language and then design it In general, it is used to describe and verify systems, and its purpose is: to help software engineers build more reliable systems, traditional methods: include only a set of graphics, tables and texts, we cannot know whether the system is free from errors and complete using these normal methods, and we may have a conflict in the system and a contradiction, and this is completely unacceptable We have in building systems, especially critical systems, as for mathematical methods: it is inherited from others that they allow the software engineer to build specifications that have no problems and are more consistent with each other, and mathematical methods use group theory, symbols and logic to create a clear set of facts and requirements It is not analyzed and then it can be analyzed to prove that it is free from errors and integrated with each other. Therefore, mathematical representation reduces ambiguity more from the use of rich mathematical methods, the importance of mathematical methods: ensure perfection and perfection of the program, work by proving that the programs are correct, involve complex mathematics, increase development costs, no one uses them for actual projects . Benefits of Mathematical Methods: Eliminate defects in the systems we want to build, help understand the system in a clear and accurate way, and are highly useful when we develop very critical systems, so their use is very important, and when we use these methods, it should help us reduce costs in systems critical if the system fails. The challenges that these methods face ,Mathematical: It is often difficult to understand some mathematical symbols, and the techniques used may not be scalable.
